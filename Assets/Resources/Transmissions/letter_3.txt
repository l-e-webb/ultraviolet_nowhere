[Wei]Dear Alleline,

Want to hear something bizarre? When I came back to my cabin and found a message from you waiting, I wanted to wait to open it. To savor the anticipation. Can you imagine? How much more anticipation do I need!
#
[Wei]I'm afraid I don't have much to report. Nothing has changed since the note I sent you last week--though I suppose that when you get this, my last message will have arrived weeks and weeks ago.
#
[Wei]After so much waiting, you deserve a real update. I know I should go for quality over quantity, but I can't help but reply immediately, knowing every second I wait is doubled, tripled, quadrupled in the vast space between us. Already, over a year will pass before this arrives.
#
[Wei]I'll send another transmission soon, with something real to say. Please look forward to it.

Yours,
Wei
