If you are reading this, I am already dead. Possibly for millennia. My ship has been crushed into a singularity, my matter made one with the remains of nearly a thousand stars. Yet, I am content. I have seen the lantern of the goddess of death, and followed it's path. I have seen the event horizon of the black hole <i>Hecate X-1</i> with my own two eyes.

A corona, it would properly be called. Yet through my window of carbonite glass, it appeared to me as an aurora. A line, cutting across the void; above it, the twisted photon emissions of distant galaxies, whipped around her like comets, shimmering mirages of long-dead stars, breaking free of her grip to strike my eyes; below it, only darkness.

In a few minutes, the gravitational forces will become too much for my paltry statsis field. I'm hurtling towards her at thousands of kilometers per second, with no hope of altering my course, yet I feel perfectly still. Soon, motion itself will lose meaning.

I'm transmitting this omnidirectionally. Most of these waves will either fall into Hecate, never to be seen, or break straight away from her, out into space. But some few will skirt the aurora on the horizon. They will become caught in an orbit, spiraling slowly outward, possibly for thousands of years before finally breaking free and flying out across space.

I wonder... which signal did you receive?
