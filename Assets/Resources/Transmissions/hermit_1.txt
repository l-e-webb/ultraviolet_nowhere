[GravityWong]Eat your heart out, Thoreau. The woods? A pond? Get real. I've got the Paul MRL-Dritsh Nebula off my port bow and Amaterasu in my sights, lightyears away but dominating the horizon, and not a living soul within a terameter. I'm transcendental as <i>shit</i>.

[GravityWong]So an update on the whole talking to myself thing: my voice literally gave out a couple of days ago. Ironic, I know. I guess at some point I started kind of shouting? Just to hear a noise? But now I can't talk at all and it's waaaaay better. I can hear, like, the hum of the universe...

[GravityWong]Except by "the universe" I mean the air circulation system. Same shit, basically.
