[Alleline]Dear Wei,

A transmission makes distant times and places coincident. How very <i>you</i>. I'd say the way you find poetry in everything is what I miss most about you, but it can take a number and wait in line. I miss everything about you.
#
[Alleline]Things are going fine here. Boring, but fine. We're passing through a whole lot of nothing. I wish I could say more but truly the most interesting thing that has happened this entire trip is your message. Somehow, I though it would tide me over. Make me miss you less. That this would get easier to bear. But it will be months and months before you even receive this.
#
[Alleline]This... is going to get harder, isn't it?

[Alleline]Love,
Alleline
