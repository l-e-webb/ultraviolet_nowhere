[Hester]Hi sweetheart. It's been awhile since my last note so I thought I'd reach out and tell you I'm doing alright out here. It's gotten a bit lonely if only because I know it's getting to be Thanksgiving time back in the States--it's been a long time since we've had to spend one apart, and now we'll probably never have one together again, you know?

[Hester]It's okay though! I'm not too sad--the research I'm doing can save the world, right? Or at least the species might have a better chance of surviving out here once my journey is complete and the data is received back at the Institute.
