[GravityWong]Well, I'm here. In the middle of the Amataresu Hypercluster. There are more stars visible in a 10-degree cone from this spot than there in the entire sky on Old Earth. So, <i>that's</i> neat, I guess.
#
[GravityWong]I once read a story about Amaterasu, Japanese goddess of the heavens. Her brother, a kind of bad egg god named Susano-o was getting all up in her shit, and she stood at the gates of heaven with her bow drawn and like a thousand arrows ready, waiting for him.
#
[GravityWong]I remember this one line... "She stood forth, like unto a mighty man, and demanded: 'Wherefore ascendest thou hither?'"

She seems like a badass. I kinda see why they named a freaking hypercluster after her.
#
[GravityWong]That's the question I see written in the stars here. Wherefore ascendest thou hither?
