[GravityWong]Scenery in deep space has a way of outliving its welcome. I've been heading for Amaterasu for over two years and it looks the same all the god damn time. There was a supernova a few months ago, so that was a minor change in one tiny corner for a few weeks. But yeah, other than that, <i>exactly</i> the same.
#
[GravityWong]Two very important things have happened recently. One: I fixed the fabricator, which <i>basically</i> means I now have as much marijuana as I could ever want--which is a lot, to be fair. Two: I learned to play the banjo. I swear to <i>God</i> the two aren't related.
#
[GravityWong]I was <i>going</i> to learn the mandolin because, like, chicks <i>dig</i> the mandolin (well-known fact). But I once heard the mandolin described as "More annoying than a ukelele but less annoying than a banjo," and I thought, you know, why <i>settle</i>?
#
[GravityWong]Also I realized the seductive power of the mandolin is maybe less important since I'll probably never interact with another living soul ever again.

So that was kind of a bummer to think about. But then I learned the banjo, so, you know... all's well that ends well, or whatever.
