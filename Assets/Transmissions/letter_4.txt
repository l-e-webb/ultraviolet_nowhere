Dear Wei,

I can't do this anymore.
#
I can't pretend that increasingly infrequent transmissions from the past self of an increasingly distant lover is a relationship.  I simply cannot.  We should have known this was impossible.  We were young, and we made a hopeless choice.
#
I'm not nineteen anymore, Wei.  The truth is, I've met someone else.  Here, on my ship.  It's over.  I'm sorry.
#
I wish I could reach out across this entropic void and tell you, tell you right now, to forget about me, to get on with your life.  The most recent news I have of you is four years out of date--maybe you've come to the same conclusion since then.  Or you will in the seven years--<i>seven years</i> it will take for this transmission to reach you.

At this rate, how many more messages would we even get?
#
I'm sorry, Wei.  I'm so very sorry.

Yours,
Alleline
