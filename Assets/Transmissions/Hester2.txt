The two stars look like they're reaching for each other but can't quite touch, a feeling I understand all too well right now. But of course I'm being sappy and I shouldn't--there's nothing to be done for it now.
#
My comms unit isn't picking much up these days but space noise. You know, the standard humming and buzzing of various unseen forces interfering with my instruments. You'd think it'd get boring, but it never does. Not yet at least.
#
Sometimes I like to imagine my transmissions are being relayed back through space to you as fast as I'm making them and you're smiling at my jokes only a few seconds after I make them. It's fun to remember your face and all its lines and curves.
#
If you ever get this, I'll be gone. I'll have been gone a long time. It doesn't stop me making them though. 

I love you. 
I miss you.
