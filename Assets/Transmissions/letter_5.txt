Trip Clock: Year 14, Day 220

Dear Alleline,

Plains.
#
It's what I've decided to call these times, the droughts--now years long--between your messages.  Wide, open, barren, beautiful plains, between the peaks when I rise to the sky and your words reach me.  Another year, give or take, is when I guess I'll hear from you again.

We knew this would happen, though.  We made our decision.  I've grown very, very good at waiting.
#
I keep thinking things like, "Alleline is in his thirties, now, like me," except you're not, of course.  That's not how relativity works.  You're the young, witty, wry, darling twenty-something of your most recent message (Trip Clock: Year 9, if you're interested).
#
That's a nice thought, isn't it?  In a way, we're lucky.  We don't have to watch each other age.  When I'm old and wrinkled, you'll still be a spry forty, in your messages.
#
To me, you will never die.  Forever young, forever beautiful, forever my love.

Yours,
Wei
