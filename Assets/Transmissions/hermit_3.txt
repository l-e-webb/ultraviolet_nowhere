[Hermit]Well, I'm here.  In the middle of the Amataresu Hypercluster.  There are more stars visible in a 10-degree cone from this spot than there in the entire sky on Old Earth.  So, <i>that's</i> neat, I guess.

I once read a story about Amaterasu, Japanese goddess of the heavens.
#
[Hermit]Her brother, a kind of bad egg god named Susano-o was getting all up in her shit, and she stood at the gates of heaven with like a thousand arrows and her bow drawn, waiting for him.  I remember this one line...  "She stood forth, like unto a mighty man, and demanded: 'Wherefore ascendest thou hither?'"

She seems like a badass.  I kinda see why they named a star cluster after her.
#
[Hermit]That's the question I see written in the stars here.  Wherefore ascendest thou hither?
