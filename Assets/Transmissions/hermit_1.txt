[Hermit]Eat your heart out, Thoreau.  The woods?  A pond?  Get real.  I've got the Antigone Nebula off my port bow and Amaterasu in my sights, lightyears away but dominating the horizon, and not a living soul within a terameter.  I'm transcendental as <i>shit</i>.

[Hermit]So an update on the whole talking to myself thing: my voice literally gave out a couple of days ago.  Ironic, I know.  I guess at some point I started kind of shouting?  Just to hear a noise?  But now I can't talk at all and it's waaaaay better.  I can hear, like, the hum of the universe...

[Hermit]Except by "the universe" I mean the air circulation system.  Same shit, basically.
