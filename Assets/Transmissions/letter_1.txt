Dear Alleline,

Your first transmission just arrived!  I opened it immediately, of course.  What a strange feeling.  The captain is always talking about the bleak divergence of space-time, and yet, to me, the topology of our reality is more forgiving.
#
Your message somehow made me, moments ago, and you, three weeks and millions of kilometers away, coincident.  I won't say anything like neither distance nor time separates two hearts connected--oh, drat, I suppose I just <i>did</i>.  Forgive me.
#
By my calculation it will be nearly three months before this reaches you.  Sorry you drew the short straw and had to send the first message.  Know that I am well, and that I love you very much.


Yours,
Wei.
